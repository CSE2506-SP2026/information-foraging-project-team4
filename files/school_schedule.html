        <h2>Bear Track Program / Extended Options</h2>
        <p>
          The Bear Tracks program provides an extension of classroom activities for children who are enrolled in the half-day program. Children who attend Bear Tracks are ready for more than half-day classes but perhaps not full-day schedules.
        </p>
        <div class="bear-tracks-info">
          <h3>Bear Tracks Schedule</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Morning Bear Tracks:</strong> Tuesday through Friday, 9:45 a.m. – 12:30 p.m. (for afternoon students)</li>
            <li><strong>Afternoon Bear Tracks:</strong> Monday through Friday, 11:45 a.m. – 2:30 p.m. (for morning students)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Parents may enroll their children for participation in Bear Tracks for any or all days it is offered.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to free choice, outdoor time and a snack, the daily Bear Tracks schedule includes a special activity. These activities are designed to engage a smaller, multi-age group of children in hands-on learning in a specialized content area, such as art, science, movement or literacy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main goal for the Bear Tracks program is to continue the progress children are making in their regular classroom within a varied and creative curriculum. <strong>Children must be toilet-trained to enroll in Bear Tracks.</strong>
