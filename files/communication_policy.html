      <h1>Communication Policy</h1>
      <h2>
        At Washington University Nursery School, we believe that open and effective communication between parents and teachers is essential for your child's success.

        <h2>Daily Communication</h2>
        <p>
          Teachers are available to speak with parents at drop-off and pick-up times. We encourage brief conversations during these times to share information about your child's day.
        </p>
        <p>
          For more detailed discussions or concerns, please schedule a time to meet with your child's teacher outside of drop-off and pick-up hours.

          Additional conferences can be scheduled at any time by contacting your child's teacher or the school office.
