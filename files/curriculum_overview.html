      <h2>Teaching & Learning Approach</h2>
      <p>
        The philosophy of the nursery school is that children learn most effectively through play. Our approach is "hands-on," where children act upon what they are learning and feeling. We consider the process more important than the product.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Play-Based Learning:</strong> Teachers provide opportunities for children to interact with their environment in ways that are meaningful to them. Through play, children develop social and emotional skills, language and communication skills, mathematical concepts, scientific reasoning, and creative expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Individual Support:</strong> Teachers are attentive to individual needs, serving as catalysts to spark each child's interests and desire to experiment and explore. For children who need extra support, teachers provide one-on-one attention, adapted materials, and collaboration with families.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Disciplined Approach:</strong> The program brings structure and discipline while maintaining a warm, supportive environment. Teachers use positive guidance to help children develop self-control, responsibility, and respect for others. Children are encouraged to resolve conflicts through communication and problem-solving.
      </p>

      <h2>Academic Areas</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to their classroom teachers, all children actively participate with specialists in science, art, music and Spanish. Academic concepts are integrated throughout the day in meaningful, play-based contexts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Math Examples:</strong> Teachers cleverly integrate math concepts into the curriculum through art, craft, science, and play activities. Children learn through counting, sorting, measuring, pattern recognition, shape identification, and simple addition and subtraction.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Science Topics:</strong> Our science specialist, Miss Becky, brings "Nature on the Move" to each classroom monthly. Children learn about butterflies, turkeys, hibernation, animal senses, camouflage, and other Missouri wildlife through hands-on exploration and observation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Spanish Songs:</strong> Miss Colleen visits each classroom once a week for songs, games and stories in Spanish. Children learn greetings, numbers, shapes, and holiday songs. <a class="download" href="downloads/Spanish-Lyrics-and-Actions.pdf" target="_blank">Spanish Lyrics and Actions</a> are available for families.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h2>Conferences & Assessment</h2>
      <p>
        Parent-teacher conferences are held twice during the school year to discuss each child's progress, development, and learning. Teachers continuously observe and document children's learning through observation notes, portfolios, and developmental milestones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assessment at WUNS is ongoing, authentic, and comprehensive. Teachers assess all areas of development including social, emotional, cognitive, language, and physical development. The goal is to ensure that each child is ready for kindergarten and has developed a strong foundation for future learning.
