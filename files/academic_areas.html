      <h1>Academic Areas</h1>
      <p>
        In addition to their classroom teachers, all children actively participate with specialists in science, art, music and Spanish. Academic concepts are integrated throughout the day in meaningful, play-based contexts.
      </p>

      <h2>Math Examples</h2>
      <p>
        Teachers cleverly integrate math concepts into the curriculum through art, craft, science, and play activities. Children learn through:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Counting and number recognition during play, snack time, and group activities</li>
        <li>Sorting and classifying materials by color, size, shape, or type</li>
        <li>Pattern recognition using blocks, beads, and other materials</li>
        <li>Measurement and comparison of sizes, weights, and lengths</li>
        <li>Shape identification and description in their environment</li>
        <li>One-to-one correspondence during snack time and art projects</li>
        <li>Simple addition and subtraction through stories, games, and real-world situations</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Science Topics</h2>
      <p>
        Our science specialist, Miss Becky, brings "Nature on the Move" to each classroom monthly. Children learn about butterflies, turkeys, hibernation, animal senses, camouflage, and other Missouri wildlife through hands-on exploration and observation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Science concepts are integrated into art, math, and language activities, helping children see connections across subject areas. Teachers support children as they develop early science reasoning skills through questioning, observation, and hands-on exploration.
      </p>

      <h2>Spanish Songs</h2>
      <p>
        Miss Colleen visits each classroom once a week for songs, games and stories in Spanish. Children learn greetings, numbers, shapes, and holiday songs. The program keeps Spanish learning fun, simple, and multi-sensory through song, props, games, and movement.
