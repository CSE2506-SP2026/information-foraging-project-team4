      <h1>Teaching & Learning Approach</h1>
      <p>
        The philosophy of the nursery school is that children learn most effectively through play. Our approach is "hands-on," where children act upon what they are learning and feeling. We consider the process more important than the product.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are looking for information about how we provide personalized support for children with different
        learning styles, temperaments, or backgrounds, this page explains how our teachers and staff partner with
        families to support each child's unique needs.
      </p>

      <h2>Play-Based Learning</h2>
      <p>
        Teachers provide opportunities for children to interact with their environment in ways that are meaningful to them. Through play, children develop social and emotional skills, language and communication skills, mathematical concepts, scientific reasoning, and creative expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        Teachers develop curriculum that reflects the interests and abilities of the children in each classroom, ensuring that learning is engaging, relevant, and developmentally appropriate.
      </p>

      <h2>Individual Support Approach</h2>
      <p>
        Teachers are attentive to individual needs, serving as catalysts to spark each child's interests and desire to experiment and explore. Our school provides a safe, nurturing environment that encourages growth and independence in all developmental areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        The staff respects and appreciates the talents and personalities of each child and his or her family. For children who need extra support, whether in learning English, adapting to new environments, or developing specific skills, teachers provide one-on-one attention, adapted materials, and collaboration with families.
      </p>
      <p>
        University student workers in each classroom enable children to receive additional individual attention, further supporting personalized learning experiences.
      </p>

      <h2>Disciplined Approach</h2>
      <p>
        The program brings structure and discipline while maintaining a warm, supportive environment. Teachers use positive guidance to help children develop self-control, responsibility, and respect for others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Teachers model respectful behavior and guide children in developing social-emotional skills. When conflicts arise, teachers help children express their feelings, listen to others, and find solutions together. Children are encouraged to resolve conflicts through communication and problem-solving.
