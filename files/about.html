                            The Washington University Nursery School was founded in 1947 as a
                            cooperative venture of faculty and Washington University in St.
                            Louis. The primary purpose of the nursery school is to provide the
                            highest quality preschool program for children 2 years and 7
                            months to 5 years of age.

                            The nursery school also serves as a site for research in child
                            development and early childhood teacher training. Washington
                            University undergraduate and graduate students are employed to
                            assist in the classrooms. The classroom teachers, as well as the
                            nursery school's director, supervise them. The student workers'
                            presence enables children to receive additional individual
                            attention.

                            The nursery school is located on the Washington University campus.
                            It is composed of three classrooms which are designed to offer
                            children a variety of choices in their play. Two additional

                            indoor gross motor play materials. A large outdoor play area
                            gives children the opportunity to run, bike, swing, climb, slide
                            and play in the sand.
