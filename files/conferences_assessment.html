      <h1>Conferences & Assessment</h1>
      <p>
        Washington University Nursery School is committed to supporting each child's growth and development. We assess children's knowledge, support their growth, and share results with parents through regular communication and formal conferences.
      </p>

      <h2>Parent-Teacher Conferences</h2>
      <p>
        Parent-teacher conferences are held twice during the school year to discuss each child's progress, development, and learning. These conferences provide opportunities for sharing observations about your child's social, emotional, cognitive, and physical development, discussing strengths and areas for growth, and reviewing examples of your child's work and learning experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conferences are scheduled during designated conference days when school is closed for regular classes. This allows teachers to dedicate full attention to meaningful conversations with each family. In addition to formal conferences, teachers are available to communicate with parents regularly through daily conversations, newsletters, and informal check-ins as needed.
      </p>

      <h2>Assessment & Documentation</h2>
      <p>
        Teachers continuously observe and document children's learning and development throughout the school year. Assessment at WUNS is ongoing, authentic, and comprehensive. Teachers assess all areas of development including social, emotional, cognitive, language, and physical development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assessment methods include observation notes and anecdotal records, photographs and videos of children's work and play, portfolios of children's art, writing, and projects, checklists and developmental milestones, and conversations with children about their thinking and learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        This documentation helps teachers plan appropriate activities, track progress, and share meaningful information with families. The goal is to ensure that each child is ready for kindergarten and has developed a strong foundation for future learning.
